| OrganicEditorState | Is an application state that recieves events from CVEngine such as update, render, etc. It contains the active tool being used, the main workstate, and other major components.                                                                                                                                  |
| WorkState          | Contains data about the current state/ChemLevelPair. Previous state data is also saved to allow for undo and redo                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ChemLevelPair      | A bundle of the IMoleculeManager and a related EntityLevel                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Tool               | A tool saves a temp copy of the workstate and performs editor actions on it. A tool also has a local workstate object to manage internal state restoration. Once an action has fully completed the latest state is commited to the main workstate held in the OrganicEditorState                                 |
| EditorAction       | Different actions modify the state by using the molecule manager and the entitylevel. Actions ensure the two components never get out of sync. Once an action has started it must finish to intended completion. Inserting atoms, creating single bonds, and creating double bonds, are all done through actions |
